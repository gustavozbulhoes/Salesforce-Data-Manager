# Salesforce-Data-Manager
The goal of this repository is to build a custom, non-admin user-friendly Salesforce feature designed to empower non-admin users with the ability to bulk update, insert, and delete Salesforce records. This tool will provide functionality similar to Salesforce Organizer extention, Salesforce Data Loader and Data Import Wizard, but with enhanced flexibility through customizable access permissions.
